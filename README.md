# Access Key Management and Token Information Retrieval System

This project consists of two microservices: the Access Key Management Service and the Token Information Service. Both services are built using NestJS and use Redis for Pub/Sub communication and SQLite for database storage.

## Services

### Access Key Management Service

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Description**: This service is responsible for generating access keys for users, defining rate limits, expiration times, and providing administrative capabilities to create or delete keys. Users can retrieve their plan details using their key.

### Token Information Service

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Description**: This service allows users to fetch token information based on their access keys. It respects the rate limits and expiration times defined in the keys generated by the Access Key Management Service.


## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites

### Building and Running the Services
